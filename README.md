<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A web & mobile app that allows businesses to share with their customers when they had a cancellation, and that allows customers to add themselves to a business's waitlist.</p>
<p>The app uses the user's location and the Google Places API to find nearby businesses, and allows users to join a waitlist that will inform them when said business has had a cancellation that they could benefit from.</p>
<p>Businesses can manage the people in the waitlist to try and find the best fit for their available spot.</p>
<p>Notifications are sent by the users' desired channels (push or SMS) when an opportunity opens up, and they then have a limited amount of time to accept it before the chance is given to someone else, in order to try and fill the spots as efficiently as possible.</p>
